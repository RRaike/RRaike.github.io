Hi there! This is my website. It is still under construction.<br>

Hi there! I am Roel. I come from the best, small town in Belgium; Rekem. With a distinct love for science, I obtained my BS in Engineering Science at KU Leuven and my MS in Chemical Engineering at KU Leuven and the University of Delaware. Now, I am working on my doctorate at Ã‰cole polytechnique de Lausanne (EPFL). My research interest is in mathematical and computational modeling of complex chemical systems.
