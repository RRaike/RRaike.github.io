Hi there! I am Roel and I have a love for science. I obtained my BS in Engineering Science at KU Leuven and my MS in Chemical Engineering at KU Leuven and the University of Delaware. Now, I am working on my doctorate at Ã‰cole polytechnique de Lausanne (EPFL). My research interest is in mathematical and computational modeling of complex chemical systems. Besides research, I have always tried to convey my passion for the field through teaching initiatives be that through teaching assistantships, participating in the Peer Assisted Learning Framework, or helping with writing coursework.
