Hi there! I am Roel and I have a love for science. I obtained my BS in Engineering Science at KU Leuven and my MS in Chemical Engineering at KU Leuven and the University of Delaware. Now, I am working on my doctorate at Ã‰cole polytechnique de Lausanne (EPFL). My research interest is in mathematical and computational modeling of complex chemical systems. Besides research, I have always tried to convey my passion for the field through teaching initiatives be that through teaching assistantships, participating in the Peer Assisted Learning Framework, or helping with writing coursework.

As any good academic, I have a healthy coffee addiction about which I can talk for hours. The equipment, the beans, the brew time, the grind size...  For the moment, I use my trusted moka pot at home and a french press in the office. In addition to my quest to perfect my bean tea, I adore going for a run and reading a good book. If you have any suggestions on how to improve my cup in the morning, want to go for a run together or have a book recommendation, then do not hesistate to reach out!
